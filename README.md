# Machine-Learning-Demos
Two Python notebooks in which Stochastic Gradient Descent and K-means algorithms are run over the Spark framework. They were, respectively, the first and the second laboratory sessions for the "Clouds" course we have followed at Eurecom.

## Projects overview
### SGD
The goal of this demo is to present the Gradient Descent algorithm and some of its variants (Stochastic GD and Mini-batch SGD). 
Algorithms are analysed while running on a single machine and distributed over the cluster.

### K-means
The clustering algorithm is presented and run over a dataset (also in a distributed fashion). The K-means++ variant, useful to determine the initial cluster centroids in a smart way, is analyzed too.

### How to access the project files
You can find the Python Notebooks exported as HTML files, which are more portable in terms of readability.

## Special thanks
We want to thank you our teacher, <a href="https://github.com/michiard" target="_blank">Michiardi Pietro</a>, who has realized the baseline for the notebooks and has guided us during their realization, teaching us all the techniques presented here.
